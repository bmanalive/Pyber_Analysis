# Module 5 PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Using Python, Pandas, & Matplotlib to Analyze PyBer Ridesharing Results with Jupyter Notebooks

### Purpose
PyBer, a ridesharing app company, has requested the following:
* Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
* Using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
* Submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Election-Audit Summary: 
This script could be modified to pull and display any number of regional data points such as state and city, allowing analysis at those levels as well.  This could easily be run by adding a City and State column to the .csv file and reading data in the same way as county information.
By modifying the dictionaries within the code, the election commision could view percentage of the county vote and county vote total per candidate.
